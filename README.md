# Sports-team-scheduler
This is a repository that is playing around to create a local sports league game schedule generator.

The basis of this is an R script to generate a schedule for a local softball league. It is for me to learn how I could optimize the schedule using R.

This script is not intended for anything other than my personal learning purposes.
